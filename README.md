### Project Description
This project is a Parking System with Automatic Gate Control, which uses infrared (IR) sensors, a servo motor, and a LiquidCrystal display (LCD) to know about the vacant slots available.

### The Problem statement
The lack of real-time information about slot availability can result in over-occupancy or under-utilization of parking resources.

### The Solution
The solution to the problem of managing parking slots and automating the entry and exit process is achieved by developing a Parking System with Automated Gate Control.
